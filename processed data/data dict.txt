Columns labeled "Alpha", "Delta" etc. are variant proportions, i.e. 0.75 means that 75% of the cases on that day are of the specific variant

airport_adj_matrix is an adjacency matrix for all IL counties, 
	with 1 meaning that county has an airport and is thus connected to all other counties with airports

border_adj_matrix is an adjacency matrix for all IL counties, 
	with the number representing the length of the shared border in meters

highway_adj_matrix is an adjacency matrix for all IL counties, 
	with the number representing the number of shared interstates between two given counties

To create the full adjacency matrix, linearly combine the three adjacency matrices, with any weights of your choosing to each matrix

r0 contains the r0 for 5 different variants. You can manually add the r0 for more variants by searching if needed.
